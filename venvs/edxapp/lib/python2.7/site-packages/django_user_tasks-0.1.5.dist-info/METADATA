django-user-tasks is a reusable Django application for managing user-triggered
asynchronous tasks.  It provides a status page for each such task, which
includes a meaningful progress indicator if the task is currently being
executed and provides any appropriate text and/or links for output once the
task is complete.

In Open edX, such tasks include operations such as exporting or importing a
course, sending an email to all the students in a course, uploading a video,
and other tasks which often take too long to perform during a single web
request (as outlined in `OEP-3`_).  However, this has been written with the
intention of being useful in a variety of Django projects outside the Open edX
platform as well.

Note that this library was created as a consolidation of lessons learned from
implementing such tasks in various parts of the Open edX code base.  They
don't yet all use this library, but the plan is to over time refactor many of
them to do so.

Overview
--------

django-user-tasks is currently a wrapper for `Celery`_ (although the hope is
that it could also be extended to also support `channels`_ and other
asynchronous task queues).  By extending the provided ``UserTask`` class (or
adding ``UserTaskMixin`` to an existing Task subclass) and providing a
``user_id`` task argument, the task's status is stored in a database table
separate from the Celery broker and result store.  This ``UserTaskStatus``
model allows for full database queries of the tasks that users are most likely
to care about while not imposing any restrictions on the Celery configuration
most appropriate for the site's overall needs for asynchronous task
processing.

Most of the status updating is handled automatically via Celery's `signals`_
mechanism, but it can be enhanced by:

* Overriding the ``UserTaskMixin`` methods such as ``generate_name`` and
  ``calculate_total_steps`` for particular types of tasks
* Calling some of the ``UserTaskStatus`` methods like
  ``increment_completed_steps`` and ``set_state`` from the task implementation
* Saving task output as instances of the ``UserTaskArtifact`` model

Change Log
----------

..
   All enhancements and patches to cookiecutter-django-app will be documented
   in this file.  It adheres to the structure of http://keepachangelog.com/ ,
   but in reStructuredText instead of Markdown (for ease of incorporation into
   Sphinx documentation and the PyPI description).

   This project adheres to Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/).

.. There should always be an "Unreleased" section for changes pending release.

Unreleased
~~~~~~~~~~

*

[0.1.5] - 2017-08-03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed
+++++++

* Added testing/support for Django 1.11.

[0.1.4] - 2017-01-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed
+++++++

* Slightly improved handling of tasks which start before their status records
  are committed (due to database transactions).  Also documented how to avoid
  this problem in the first place.

[0.1.3] - 2017-01-03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed
+++++++

* Tasks which were explicitly canceled, failed, or retried no longer have
  their status changed to ``Succeeded`` just because the task exited cleanly.
* Celery tasks which fail to import cleanly by name (because they use a custom
  name which isn't actually the fully qualified task name) are now just ignored
  in the ``before_task_publish`` signal handler.

[0.1.2] - 2016-12-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed
+++++++

* Add a migration to explicitly reference the setting for artifact file storage.
  This setting is likely to vary between installations, but doesn't affect the
  generated database schema.  This change should prevent ``makemigrations``
  from creating a new migration whenever the setting value changes.

[0.1.1] - 2016-10-11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed
+++++++

* Fix Travis configuration for PyPI deployments.
* Switch from the Read the Docs Sphinx theme to the Open edX one for documentation.


[0.1.0] - 2016-10-07
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added
+++++

* First attempt to release on PyPI.
