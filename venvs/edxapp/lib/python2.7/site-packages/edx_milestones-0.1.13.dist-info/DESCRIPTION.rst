===================

edx-milestones (`milestones`) is a Django application which manages significant Course and/or Student events in the Open edX platform.

Usage
-----
*  A Milestone represents an event which can occur for a student while interacting with the Open edX platform.

*  Relationships can be created between courses or individual sections of course content (referred to collectively as course entities going forward) and a Milestone. A relationship can indicate that a course entity either requires or fulfills a given Milestone.

*  Student milestone fulfillment status can be recorded and queried.

*  An example feature which Milestones supports is Pre-requisite Courses:
    * Course author selects Course 101 in Studio as a pre-requisite of Course 102
        * Studio:
            * Makes call to Milestones service API
        * Milestones:
            * Creates a new generic Milestone A for Course 101
            * Indicates that Course 101 fulfills Milestone A
            * Indicates that Course 102 requires Milestone A
    * Student Smith completes Course 101
        * LMS:
            * Makes call to Milestones service API
        * Milestones:
            * Pulls the list of milestones fulfilled by Course 101 (set includes Milestone A)
            * Indicates that Student Smith has accomplished Milestone A
    * Student Smith attempts to access Course 102
        * LMS:
            * Uses Milestones service API to compare Course 102 milestone requirements against Student Smith's milestones
            * Grants Student Smith access to Course 102
