edx-organizations |Build Status| |Coverage Status|
==================================================

edx-organizations (``organizations``) is a Django application
responsible for managing the concept of Organizations in the Open edX
platform. Organizations represent the entities responsible for creating
and publishing Courses. In the future the scope and responsibilty of the
Organization may evolve to include other aspects, such as related
learners.
