edx-sphinx-theme is a Sphinx theme for `Open edX`_ documentation.  It should be
used for all documentation in repositories in the ``edx`` GitHub organization
which is intended to be used with the `Sphinx`_ documentation system.

.. _Open edX: https://open.edx.org/
.. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/

Overview
--------

This theme makes the following changes to the default Sphinx output:

* Displays the edX logo
* Adds a link to a feedback form that identifies which page the feedback came from

To use edx-sphinx-theme for a repository's documentation:

* ``pip install edx-sphinx-theme`` or equivalent (add ``edx-sphinx-theme``
  to any appropriate requirements files)
* Add ``edx_theme`` to the ``extensions`` list in conf.py (it adds the
  feedback form URL to the rendering context for each page).
* Update the ``html_theme`` and ``html_theme_path`` values in conf.py so the
  theme can be located and loaded.
* Set ``html_favicon`` to the path of the favicon.ico file in the theme.
* Use the ``AUTHOR`` constant where appropriate in conf.py
  (this default is only provided as a convenience; the repository is free
  to use another value if appropriate).

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import edx_theme

    extensions = ['edx_theme']

    copyright = '{year}, edX Inc.'.format(year=datetime.datetime.now().year)
    author = edx_theme.AUTHOR

    html_theme = 'edx_theme'
    html_theme_path = [edx_theme.get_html_theme_path()]
    html_favicon = os.path.join(html_theme_path[0], 'edx_theme', 'static', 'css', 'favicon.ico')

    latex_documents = [
        (master_doc, 'edx-sphinx-theme.tex', 'edx-sphinx-theme Documentation',
         author, 'manual'),
    ]

Read the Docs Configuration
---------------------------

Because this theme is a Python package which needs to be installed, `Read the
Docs`_ needs to be configured appropriately to be able to install it when
performing documentation builds.  Under ``Advanced Settings``:

* ``Install your project inside a virtualenv using setup.py install`` should
  be checked
* ``Requirements file`` should point to a pip requirements file which includes
  ``open-edx-theme``.
