Event Tracking library |build-status|
=====================================

The ``event-tracking`` library tracks context-aware semi-structured system events. 
It captures and stores events with nested data structures in order to truly 
take advantage of schemaless data storage systems.

Key features:

* Multiple backends - define custom backends that can be used to persist
  your event data.
* Nested contexts - allows data to be injected into events even without
  having to pass around all of said data to every location where the events
  are emitted.
* Django integration - provides a Django app that allows context aware events
  to easily be captured by multi-threaded web applications.
* MongoDB integration - support writing events out to a mongo collection.

Example::

    from eventtracking import tracker

    tracker = tracker.get_tracker()
    tracker.enter_context('outer', {'user_id': 10938})
    tracker.emit('navigation.request', {'url': 'http://www.edx.org/some/path/1'})

    with tracker.context({'user_id': 11111, 'session_id': '2987lkjdyoioey'}):
        tracker.emit('navigation.request', {'url': 'http://www.edx.org/some/path/2'})

    tracker.emit(
        'address.create',
        {
            'name': 'foo',
            'address': {
                'postal_code': '90210',
                'country': 'United States'
            }
        }
    )

Running the above example produces the following events::

    {
        "name": "navigation.request",
        "timestamp": ...,
        "context": {
            "user_id": 10938
        },
        "data": {
            "url": "http://www.edx.org/some/path/1"
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "navigation.request",
        "timestamp": ...,
        "context": {
            "user_id": 11111,
            "session_id": "2987lkjdyoioey"
        },
        "data": {
            "url": "http://www.edx.org/some/path/2"
        }
    },    
    {
        "name": "address.create",
        "timestamp": ...,
        "context": {
            "user_id": 10938
        },
        "data": {
            "name": "foo",
            "address": {
                "postal_code": "90210",
                "country": "United States"
            }
        }
    }


Roadmap
-------

In the very near future the following features are planned:

* Dynamic event documentation and event metadata - allow event emitters to
  document the event types, and persist this documentation along with the
  events so that it can be referenced during analysis to provide context
  about what the event is and when it is emitted.
