    Send events to segment.com

    It is assumed that other code elsewhere initializes the segment.com API and makes calls to analytics.identify.

    Requires all emitted events to have the following structure (at a minimum)::

        {
            'name': 'something',
            'context': {
                'user_id': 10,
            }
        }

    Additionally, the following fields can optionally be defined::

        {
            'context': {
                'agent': "your user-agent string",
                'client_id': "your google analytics client id",
                'host': "your hostname",
                'ip': "your IP address",
                'page': "your page",
                'path': "your path",
                'referer': "your referrer",
            }
        }

    The 'page', 'path' and 'referer' are sent to Segment as "page" information.  If the 'page' is absent but the 'host'
    and 'path' are present, these are used to create a URL value to substitute for the 'page' value.

    Note that although some parts of the event are lifted out to pass explicitly into the Segment.com API, the entire
    event is sent as the payload to segment.com, which includes all context, data and other fields in the event.
